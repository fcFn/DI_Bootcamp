-- üåü Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.

-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?

-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?

-- Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet).

-- Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet)

-- Your friend is at the store, and decides to rent a movie. He knows he wants to see 4 movies, but he can‚Äôt remember their names. Can you help him find which movies he wants to rent?
-- The 1st film : The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.

-- The 2nd film : A short documentary (less than 1 hour long), rated ‚ÄúR‚Äù.

-- The 3rd film : A film that his friend Matthew Mahan rented. He paid over $4.00 for the rental, and he returned it between the 28th of July and the 1st of August, 2005.

-- The 4th film : His friend Matthew Mahan watched this film, as well. It had the word ‚Äúboat‚Äù in the title or description, and it looked like it was a very expensive DVD to replace.

UPDATE

SET
  language_id = 1
WHERE
  film_id IN (1, 2, 3);

-- The foreign keys defined for the customer table are:
-- - address_id
-- The foreign keys affect the way we INSERT into the customer table because we
-- need to make sure that the values we insert into address_id are valid values 
-- that exist in the address table.

DROP TABLE customer_review;
-- Dropping the table is an easy step because we only need to run the DROP TABLE
