<!-- Instructions:
In this exercise, you will use object oriented programming concepts to define and use a custom object in JavaScript.
1. Create a class named `Video`. The class should be constructed with the following parameters:
   * title (a string)
   * uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it)
   * time (a number, the duration of the video - in seconds)
2. Create a method called `watch()` which displays a string as follows: "uploader parameter watched all time parameter of title parameter!"
3. Instantiate a new `Video` instance and call the `watch()` method.
4. Instantiate a second `Video` instance with different values.
5. Bonus: Use an array to store data for five `Video` instances (ie. title, uploader, time) Think of the best data structure to save this information within the array.
6. Bonus: Loop through the array to instantiate those instances.
