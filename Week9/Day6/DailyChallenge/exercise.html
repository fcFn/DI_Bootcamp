<!-- Instructions:
Create a function that:
* takes in two strings as two parameters
* and returns a boolean that indicates whether or not the first string is an anagram of the second string.

Some Help:
* What is an anagram? An anagram is another word or phrase formed by rearranging letters of the first word or phrase.
* Example of anagrams:
  "Astronomer" is an anagram of "Moon starer"
  "School master" is an anagram of "The classroom"
  "The Morse Code" is an anagram of "Here come dots"
* Do we need to consider whitespace? Trim whitespace prior to comparison.
